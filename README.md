# What are Backdoors?

A backdoor in software is a method by which an unauthorized user can gain access to a system, network, or application, often bypassing standard security measures. Backdoors can be used for various purposes, including testing and research, but they also raise significant security and ethical concerns.

## Types of Backdoors

Backdoors can come in various forms, including:

- **Hardcoded Credentials:** Fixed usernames and passwords embedded in the code for developer use.
- **Hidden Functions:** Special functions within the software that grant access to restricted areas.
- **Unpatched Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting known security flaws that have not been addressed.

## Open Source Backdoor Projects

For research and educational purposes, open source backdoor projects can be studied to understand their design and implementation. Some notable examples include:

- [Backdoor Project(s)](https://github.com/Blood-Gang-Inc/backdoor/releases)
- [Saz](https://github.com/Blood-Gang-Inc/sa-zserverside)
