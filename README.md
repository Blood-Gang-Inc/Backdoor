        <h1>What are backdoors?</h1>
        <p>
            A backdoor in software is a method by which an unauthorized user can gain access to a system, network, or application, often bypassing standard security measures. Backdoors can be used for various purposes, including testing and research, but they also raise significant security and ethical concerns.
        </p> 
        <h2>Types of Backdoors</h2>
        <p>
            Backdoors can come in various forms, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardcoded Credentials:</strong> Fixed usernames and passwords embedded in the code for developer use.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Functions:</strong> Special functions within the software that grant access to restricted areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Unpatched Vulnerabilities:</strong> Exploiting known security flaws that have not been addressed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Open Source Backdoor Projects</h2>
        <p>
            For research and educational purposes, open source backdoor projects can be studied to understand their design and implementation. Some notable examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
